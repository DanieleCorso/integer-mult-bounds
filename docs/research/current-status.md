# Current main: reviewed paired-cube construction

The selected conditional witness is **κ=4609169/10000000000=0.0004609169**,
from icekylinx's [PR #144](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/144).
This is about 9.03 times the preceding main saving, approximately `2^-11.0832`.
It is above `2^-12` and below `2^-11`.

The construction builds on icekylinx's compiler lineage, an664's #128
completed-core sharing, eumemic's #117 producer, Zhihao Chen's #97 physical
ledger and Swapnil Jain's underlying frozen word. See the
[review and attribution](community-round6-review.md),
[validation receipt](community-round6-validation.json),
[selected result record](../../certificates/selected-result.json), and
[reproduction guide](../paired-cube.md).

The retained upstream analytic, semantic and fixed-tape interfaces remain
assumed. The finite controls and written audit do not formally verify the
full multiplication theorem. The review distinguishes local checks from
head-pinned Linux CI evidence; no independent human peer review is claimed.

# Previous checkpoint: joint-frame community construction

The selected conditional witness is **κ=25508460085039/500000000000000000
=5.1016920170078e-5 > 2^-15**, from Avi Eisenberg's #62 pair assembly, eumemic's
#57 compiler, and Alejandro Zarzuelo Urdiales's #61 parameter refinement.
It is 23.71% above the previous #49 release, and remains below 2^-14.
See the [review and contribution ledger](community-round2-review.md),
[independent arithmetic](community-pair-arithmetic.json), and
[selected certificate](../../research/matrix-exponent-synthesis/candidate/arithmetic.json).

The original #109 framework and inherited all-size analytic/fixed-tape
interfaces remain assumed. Scoped Lean checks do not prove the full algorithm.
Submissions after #62 are not included in this review checkpoint.

# Previous release: community follow-up witness

The selected conditional witness is **κ=4123863984/10^14=4.123863984e-5 > 2^-15**,
from PR #49 at `f95d2910e027495983b53cae1693cf535abf2569`. It improves the
previous PR #39 release by 6.10%, retaining its analytic and fixed-tape contracts.
See the [follow-up review](community-followup-review.md),
[integration record](community-followup-integration.md),
[exact certificate](../../research/climbed-48/certificate.json), and
[contributor record](../../CONTRIBUTORS.md).

PR #45 (Gaussian parity and finite tensor execution) and PR #26 (historical
arithmetic and algebraic contracts) are incorporated as scoped formal verification.
Their Lean builds and axiom audits do not prove the complete multiplication theorem.
The original #109 framework remains assumed; no independent human peer review is claimed.

The [preserved research index](preserved-research.md) collects the earlier
compression and topology searches, with scoped exclusions and reproduction commands.

The previous PR #39 release and tested 2^-30 checkpoint at `1a74950` remain
preserved. Everything below is historical: “latest” and “current” refer to the
checkpoint, not the selected community follow-up witness.

# Current contracts and research status

Updated October 8, 2026. Author: Douglas Colkitt.

The latest included conditional witness is **kappa=2^-30**. Its
[note](../../artifacts/ternary-note.pdf),
[certificate](../../certificates/ternary-side.json), and
[independent patch](../../patches/ternary-30.patch) are described in the
[review guide](ternary-review.md). The previous 2^-31 construction and all
older witnesses remain unchanged.

The bit circuit uses F3 scalar arithmetic and rational frames on five-subset
labels at h=29. Its complete counts are

    m_b=24389, W_b=589493540769997500,
    s_b=14377157287342062574725,
    a_b=467/10^11.

The complex circuit is retained at a_c=5/10^9. Parameters are

    epsilon=1999/10000, c=1, beta=1/100, zeta=1/1000,
    delta=1/10^6, C1=4961/1000,
    lambda=1-4669/10^12, lambda'=1-4668/10^12,
    kappa=2^-30.

The exact minimum assembly margin is
`2332833/2500000000000000 > 2^-30`. The bound remains conditional on the
pinned upstream theorem and the retained written extensions. Finite checks
and manuscript compilation are not independent mathematical verification.

Zhihao Chen's earlier PR #7 contains the same ternary motif with a different
producer and stronger claimed bound. Further pending contributions claim
larger improvements. See the [contribution-review index](contribution-review.md)
for attribution, dependency order and the distinction between a submitted
claim and a reviewed result. This checkpoint asserts neither priority nor a
strongest-known algorithm.

## Previous 2^-31 integration record

Everything below records the preceding integration. Numerical uses of
“current,” “latest,” or “retained” in that historical record refer to 2^-31;
the parameters above supersede them for this checkpoint.

## Current and earlier results

| State | Exponent saving kappa | Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Earlier published baseline | `2^-59` | [paired note](../../artifacts/paired-note.pdf), [patch](../../patches/h50-paired-59.patch) |
| Published compact-control checkpoint | `83/10^12 > 2^-34` | [note](../../artifacts/compact-control-note.pdf), [certificate](../../certificates/compact-control-layer.json), [patch](../../patches/compact-control-34.patch) |
| Integrated follow-up, pending publication | `2^-31` | [note](../../artifacts/complex-compression-note.pdf), [certificate](../../certificates/complex-compression.json), [patch](../../patches/complex-compression-31.patch) |

The latest witness increases kappa by approximately 5.61 times over the exact
preceding witness; the dyadic comparison `2^-34` to `2^-31` is eightfold.
These compare exponent savings, not practical runtime. All earlier certificates,
patches and the pinned upstream source remain unchanged.

## What changed and what is retained

The [complex-network construction](complex-compression.md) uses weighted
rectangles for disjoint triples, shared sums for intersection-two triples,
and binary phase frames valid in both signed directions. Transparent computation
restores arbitrary auxiliary inputs. A matching shares the complete first/third
auxiliary banks. At `h_c=26`, it has

    m_c = 17576, W_c = 7082222160000,
    s_c = 124477130005280000,
    a_c = 1-sigma = 5/10^9.

The bit network remains `h_b=50`, `m_b=125000`, with
`a_b=1-tau=296/10^11`. Thus the complex interface now has the larger saving.
The bit interface is the bottleneck.

The retained compact-control construction moves compact dirty fields instead
of spaced windows, at cost `O(V*((f log p)^tau+1))`. It reserves two front
fields and one back field from existing address coordinates, preserves complete
ranges in every recursive child, restores arbitrary values, and charges
exceptional-address repair at every node. All three movement/layout/guard
proof sources are embedded verbatim in the new patch.

## Exact current parameters and bottleneck

The certificate uses

    epsilon = 199/1000, c = 1,
    beta = 1/100, zeta = 1/1000, delta = 1/10000,
    C1 = 4961/1000,
    lambda = 1-293/10^11,
    lambda' = 1-29/10^10,
    kappa = 2^-31.

The internal, leaf and reservation exponents are

    chi = tau+(1-beta)*max(sigma-tau,0) = tau,
    leaf = sigma+beta*(1-sigma),
    reserve = max(1-c,0) = 0.

All required comparisons are strict. The seven assembly margins have minimum

    G = g3 = 5771/10^13 = 5.771e-10 > 2^-31.

The explicit new scalar-operation count fits the generalized guard's node
charge `E=64*(W_c+m_c+1)^3`. The guard still has
`C1=5-4*beta+zeta`, and `epsilon*C1=987239/1000000<1`.
Reserved-axis processing costs `O(V log p)` for `c=1`.

The old quadratic restriction from `K^tau` is absent. With the **retained
certified bit exponent and Gaussian assembly inequality**, the current scoped
ceiling is `kappa<a_b/5=5.92e-10<2^-30`. This is not an all-network limitation.
The new complex saving provides numerical headroom for `2^-30` if a stronger
bit construction is supplied; that is not another established witness.

## Verification boundary

The [integration review guide](complex-compression-review.md) identifies each
new obligation and its tests. General arguments are supplied in:

- [compressed complex construction](../../notes/complex-compression.tex);
- [movement and deterministic repair](../../notes/compact-control-movement.tex);
- [reservations, row splitting and recurrence](../../notes/compact-control-layout.tex);
- [generalized guard](../../notes/compact-control-guard.tex).

The new certificate records all four source hashes. The combined patch applies
directly to the pinned original and includes the full retained refinements.
It updates every complex constant, the exponent ordering, scalar guard charge,
final parameters and derived powers. It preserves the legacy wide-slot lemma
for the appendix and retains the corrected local exceptional-stream sum.

Finite tests check exact signed scalar maps with independent dirty variables,
rectangle partitions, binary residual bases, phase identities, matching,
parameter inequalities and source integration. They do not simulate the entire
multiplication machine or replace independent proof review. The retained
compact-control arguments have the same review dependencies as before.

Completion checks passed: 176 tests, 18 patch-application checks, exact
certificate/patch regeneration, and both note and manuscript builds.

Reproduce with `make verify` and `make complex-note`. See the
[reproduction instructions](../reproducibility.md) for applying the patch and
building a manuscript preview without changing the pinned source.

## Next research priority

The complex construction is integrated. The next improvement should target
the bit finite network, especially methods transferable from the new circuit
compression or a new topology. More complex-network tuning alone cannot cross
the present bit/Gaussian ceiling. Independent review remains valuable for both
the new phase-frame transfer and the retained compact-control tape proof.

The previous [joint-frame obstruction](joint-frame-audit.md) remains scoped to
its fixed-boundary, grouped-gate model. Older research pages retain their
chronology; use this page when interpreting superseded targets and barriers.
